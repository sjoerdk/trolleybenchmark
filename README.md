# dicomtrolley benchmark

Run dicomtrolley queries and downloads, time them, plot some results.

Brings together some scripts that were lying around and becoming too unwieldy. I kept
copy-pasting little bits of code 'just for now'. Putting them in a package to have a bit more reproducibility and 
control. 

## Examples
